            <h1>How to Play</h1>
            <h2>Objective</h2>
            <ul>On an 8x8 checkerboard, the objective of the game is to target the opposing player's King and force it into a checkmate.</ul>


            <h2>Pieces</h2>
            <ul>There are two sets of colored pieces: Black and White. White always starts first.</ul>
            <ul>There are 6 different pieces in Chess. All of them, except for the Knight, collide (they cannot jump over other pieces).</ul>
            <ul><strong>Pawn:</strong> Moves can be made vertically one square forward (or two squares forward if it has not yet moved). Pawns can only capture pieces diagonally.</ul>
            <ul><strong>Rook:</strong> Moves can be made any number of squares horizontally or vertically.</ul>
            <ul><strong>Bishop:</strong> Moves can be made any number of squares diagonally.</ul>
            <ul><strong>Knight:</strong> Moves can be made with no collision two squares vertically then one square horizontally, or two squares horizontally and one square vertically.</ul>
            <ul><strong>Queen:</strong> Moves can be made any number of squares horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.</ul>
            <ul><strong>King:</strong> Moves can only be made one square horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.</ul>

            <h2>Terminology</h2>
            <ul><strong>Check:</strong> The defending player's King is targeted by the attacking player's piece, however, the defending player can protect it by either
            moving the King or using other pieces to defend it.</ul>
            <ul><strong>Checkmate:</strong> The defending player's King is targeted by the attacking player's piece and the defending player can neither move its King 
            or use other pieces to defend it.</ul>
            <ul><strong>Stalemate:</strong> A player is not checked and cannot move any pieces on their turn. Therefore, the game ends in a draw.</ul>
