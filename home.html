                      <h5 class="card-text text-center">Connect Four is a two-player board game that got its 
                        concept from the widely known game of Tic-Tac-Toe, a three in a row pencil 
                        and paper game. The Milton Bradley Company, a company well-known for the 
                        creation of various board games and video games, created this board game in 
                        1974. In the official game of Connect Four, there are 42 black and red checkered
                        pieces; 21 of each color. Players each choose one of the black or red checkered 
                        pieces and take turns dropping their colored piece from the top of a vertical game 
                        board. A typical Connect Four game board contains seven columns and six rows of space 
                        for game pieces to fall straight down, taking the lowest space that is unoccupied 
                        in the column it was dropped into. The goal of the game is to be the first player to 
                        form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four checkered pieces in the playerâ€™s 
                        color of choice.</h5>
