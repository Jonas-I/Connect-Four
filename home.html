            <h1>A Brief History</h1>
            <blockquote id="history-desc">
                The popular and widely-known game of Chess can be traced back to its origins in 6th century India. In history, <br>
                Chess has been known as not just a game, but also a tool of military strategy. As trade transpired, the game <br>
                of Chess began to transcend cultures and many variations of the game developed. In China, Chess pieces were <br>
                placed at the intersections of board squares rather than inside them. Mongolians created larger 11x10 boards <br>
                with safe squares. Meanwhile, in Japan, captured pieces could be used by the opposing player. However, it was <br>
                in Europe that the game of Chess that we know now began to take form. The game of Chess even became part of <br>
                their education! Chess became a symbol of how different social classes performed their social roles; and Chess <br>
                pieces were reinterpreted into what they are now. As time progressed, Chess became more popular and players <br>
                proliferated. In 1997, an IBM computer named Deep Blue was the first computer to defeat the sitting Chess <br>
                champion, Garry Kasparov. Today, Chess software is capable of consistently defeating the best human players. <br>
                Chess continues to be a highly popular pastime and its players make up one of the largest communities in the world.
