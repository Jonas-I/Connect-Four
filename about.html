                    <p>Tim Oh is currently a full-time student majoring in Computer Science at Queens College. 
                        His past work experience includes working as a work-study intern at the VA hospital in 
                        St. Albans, Queens. During his internship, he carried out various IT tasks (i.e. fix 
                        and repair: PC fans, update BIOS, SMART card readers, update port security, image 
                        workstations, and taking inventory on all equipment) and acquired more knowledge by 
                        shadowing the IT tech. Prior to this, he served in the U.S. Navy for 12 years and 
                        received an honorable discharge. Timâ€™s experience in the Navy allowed for him to travel 
                        and explore various destinations and cultures. He was able to see first-hand how Chess 
                        is incorporated into these cultures.</p>
